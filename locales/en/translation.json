It stores private keys in an isolated environment where no logger, debugger or spyware can intercept them because of the three-layer security protecting each action of the system. KeyChain supports transactions from and to various blockchains, including Ethereum and Ethereum classic, Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Bitshares.",

To ensure safe operations in Unix-like OS, we have created a shortcut from you entering a passphrase to the KeyChain processing it. Instead of receiving a passphrase through the X-server, KeyChain gets it directly from the keyboard driver. We exclude the weakest link (X-server) from the process, thus minimizing the risks to your key storage.",
